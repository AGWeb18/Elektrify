 <h2 align="center"> Origins of Elektris</h2>
I was driving home from the gym when I saw a family in an Electric Vehicle with their hazards on in a mall parking lot. I asked them if they needed help and they politely declined.
As I pulled in my driveway and plugged my EV into my charger, I realized theres no easy way to offer a electric vehicle charging service from your own driveway.

<h2>That is where the idea of <strong>Elektris</strong> came from.</h2>


<h3>Income Generation for Charger Owners:</h3>
By listing their chargers, individuals can generate passive income, contributing to the platforms appeal. It not only incentivizes the expansion of EV charging infrastructure but also promotes the use of renewable energy sources by making charging more accessible.

<h3>Increase the number of available chargers in rural areas</h3>
By listing their chargers, you are increasing the number of available chargers in the network, in a decentralized way since the ownerhsip/operation of your chargers will be handled via Ethereum. 

<h3>Incentivizing the transition to renewable energy</h3>
By listing their chargers, you are increasing incentives for EVERYONE, proving the viability of the business model and showing what is possible when you switch to electric. Governments may be interested in providing rebates. Companies can offset the price of the Level 2 charger with revenue sharing mechanisms.
